we can change the element from a block to inline.

display: inline;
display: inline-block;

in an inline element the padding and margin are not set from the top side. Also width and height of the element cannot be defined. so to enable a inline elemtn to enable these 4 settings, diplay: inline-block; is used

to disapear the element:
display: none;
visibility: none; block will remain but text will disappear

outline: 2px blue solid;
outline-offset: 2px;
to set outline of any text or para.

box-shadow: 3px 3px 19px 0px #7a2929;
text-shadow: 1px 0px 2px red;

to apply shadow to any element or text
