        img{
            float: right;
        }
        .divs:nth-child(3){
            background-color: aqua;
            clear: both;

        }

float is used to keep any object fixed at a place and right the texts around it. for example any image we can keep it on right suppose, then we can put the texts on left side.

clear means if we right clear:right, so in right side of that div, there will be nthg allowed, so that div will kove below.

display: flow-root;

this is used to adjust border according to the space taken by the text or img.
