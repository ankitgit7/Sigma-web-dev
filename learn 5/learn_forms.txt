form types:

these are types of input attributes:
text
radio
checkbox

you can use label tags with input as shown below

Its important to give id value to the input , so that we can use that unique id to relate it to the lable tag also.

for example

<label for="Name">Enter your username:</label>
<input type="text" id="Name" name="Username" placeholder="Enter your Username">

Also we have textarea tag to enter any text inside the box

<div>
            <label for="text">Enter your comment:</label>
            <br>
            <textarea name="comment" id="text" cols="30" rows="10" placeholder="Enter your comment here.."></textarea>
        </div>

select tag is used to create a drop down option box

also for forms there are two types:

<form action="/submit" method="post">

methods: post and get
get is a easy one, and if we want to send bigger data, then post is used
